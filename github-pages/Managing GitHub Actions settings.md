By default, GitHub Actions is enabled on all repositories and organizations. 

You can disable it or customize which actions and reusable workflows can be used

Go to mainpage of repository

--> general

--> actions -> permissions, select an option

If you choose Allow OWNER, and select non-OWNER, actions and reusable workflows, actions and reusable workflows within your organization are allowed, and there are additional options for allowing other specific actions and reusable workflows.

--> save.
